# homework-10-Bamazon

tenth homework. Node command line Amazon-like program.

Important note: The editor must be fullscreen in order to avoid an odd double-entry input error. Based on my googling, this is a bug with the inquirer package, not with my code.

The Bamazon app displays a list of items for sale and allows the user to fill a shopping cart with their choice of items. The user may add whatever they wish. Data validation will prevent the user from adding items not in the list, or from adding more of an item than exists (or trying to order nothing).

Upon checking out, the user will be told how much they were charged for how many items.
